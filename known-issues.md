LS2 Known Issues:

- The Dragon Bridge Inn alternate start CTDs when exiting the inn. Visiting Dragon Bridge after doing a different alternate start does not crash.
- The Courier seems to show up with all manner of random clothing/armor. Most of them are fine, but there are a few items that are weird on him.
- Random microstutters, unknown cause. Possibly related to skyBirds. (Or may just be I need a GPU upgrade)
- CTDs in/near Solitude and the Blue Palace? Crash log seems to indicate it's related to a container REF 000A2989 or 000B2038 (wtf Skyrim)
- A bunch of random crafting books get added to the player's inventory at start. 
- Staves aren't being properly allocated - they're showing up on enemies that are too weak to have them.
- Several weird object placements in Dawnstar, most likely caused by load order with JK's and The Great Cities patches.
- Campfire flames are red boxes sometimes. Unsure of cause.
- XPMSE Styles don't load sometimes. Unsure of cause.
