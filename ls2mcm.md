Finally:

Take the Genesis Options book from the table next to the Statue of Mara. Configure Genesis as follows:
  - Disable Spawn Near Player
  - Set the Surface Locations Spawns to zero (0).
  - Set the Dungeon Spawns to 40.

Once you have configured Genesis you can discard of the book however you like, or keep it to change settings to your liking later.

Open your Magic menu and select "Reflect..." from the powers menu.  Select whatever background/bonus you like.

And last but not least, go back into the MCM for...  

* iEquip
* **Important!: iEquip CANNOT be configured until after you have selected your Alternate Start and loaded into the gameworld proper. It will not allow you to do so until after you've loaded into your starting area.**
* General settings
  * iEquip On: Enabled
  * Now exit the menu and wait for the widget to appear.

You can configure iEquip how you want, but I recommend the following.
* Queue Options
  * Item caching and blacklisting
    * Blacklist Manually Removed Items: Enabled
  * Misc UI Options
    * Enable Widget Fadeout: Enabled
    * Fadeout Delay: 10
    * Fadeout Speed: Fast


**Save your game after completing MCM setup, I promise you do not want to have to do this process more than once.**
